# System Architecture: Navigator AI

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

Our system is designed around a **scalable, microservices-based architecture hosted on the Azure cloud**. Our user-facing product will be a **dynamic and responsive website**, ensuring full functionality and accessibility on both desktop and mobile browsers.

This approach is chosen for the following reasons:

*   **Maximum Accessibility:** Users can access our service instantly via a URL on any device, with no installation or app store required.
*   **Focused Development:** We prioritize building a world-class core web experience first, before considering app-specific features.
*   **Backend Decoupling:** Our robust backend can support any future client, be it a mobile app or partner integration.
*   **AI-Native Integration:** The architecture is designed from the ground up to leverage the full power of the Azure AI Foundry.

## 2. High-Level System Diagram

The architecture remains consistent, with the client explicitly defined as a standard web platform.
